## Front End

## Setup

- Follow **Back End Setup** section above.
- Enter front end directory, run `cd client`.
- Install dependencies, run `npm i`.

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

- If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.
- You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
